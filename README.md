## Game instructions 

This is a clone of the 2048 game. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to shift the tiles in that direction in order to reach the 2048 tile. Tiles with the same number will merge and sum up (ex. two 2's will sum up to 4). The game ends when you reach the 2048 tile.

## Run the application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install the dependencies.

### `npm start`

Run the app in the development mode.
